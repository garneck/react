# Assignment - React 7

***

## Configuration steps
Start off from your React 6 repository, then set up typescript for your project.

## Assignment goal

<details>
The goal of this project is to grasp the basics of typescript and its setup in a small-sized project, as well as familiarization with interfaces/types.
</details>

## Formal requirements
<details>

* no functionality changes should be made to your existing project
* all interfaces for components and helpers should be typed via typescript
  * this can be omitted for most complex of your elements for now, as some of them will probably require more advanced typescript - you are very welcome to try, though!
* types and interfaces should be sufficiently "atomized" to be reusable/extendable where necessary
* try and research good practices before applying a solution - there might be a few traps and caveats in even simple interfaces
* your project should be appropriately refactored to take advantage of functionalities like: optional chaining, nullish coalescing operator
</details>

# Assignment - React 6

***

## Configuration steps
Start off from your React 5 repository - no further steps should be necessary.

## Assignment goal

<details>
The goal of this assignment is to get familiarized with print media query via a concrete real-world example, as well as honing in problem-solving skills, as specific print targets might take research to achieve.
</details>

## Formal requirements
<details>

* data lists should be printable
* single list items should also be printable
* styles of lists and items should be adjusted ***when printing*** so that unnecessary elements, such as interactive ones, are hidden

* when submitting your project for review, please describe in 1-2 sentences your choice regarding solving this issue
</details>

# Assignment - React 5

***

## Configuration steps
Add react-dnd and possible dependent packages to your project

## Assignment goal

<details>
The goal of this assignment is to get familiar with libraries that enable more "visual" way of app interaction, such as react-dnd
</details>

## Formal requirements

Keep in mind that CSS should be adjusted so that the app looks coherent.

<details>
 
* data lists should be reorderable via drag and drop
* the "details" view should have all elements reorderable via drag and drop
* OPTIONAL: make it so that other elements "make space" visually in a smooth manner for the one that you are dropping
</details>

# Assignment - React 4

***

## Configuration steps
No steps this time.

## Assignment goal

<details>
The goal of this assignment is to get more familiar with efficiend code structurization via React hooks and HOCs, and learning some uses of refs.
</details>

## Formal requirements

<details>

* your data fetching logic should be contained within an appropriate hook
* you should aim to implement a minimal number of generalized hooks to cover your needs
* while loading a new page of data and while spinner is displayed, previous page data should still be displayed
* above should be achieved via a custom hook that uses a ref for previous value - try to write it yourself, even though it most probably is readily available on the internet
* Both data fetching and loading should be handled via a very general HOC that will supply every page
* Your application should now have a "dark mode" (or a light mode, if it is already dark). This should be handled with styled components theming and via a custom hook. User should be able to switch between modes via a button in the header of the page. The value of current mode should be stored in local storage
</details>

# Assignment - React 3

## Configuration steps

<details>

Make a copy of your React 2 repository with review changes applied
Install Js GraphQL plugin for Webstorm
</details>

## Assignment goal

The goal of this assignment is to get familiar with GraphQL and further improvement of Fluture knowledge via integration with GraphQL, as well as the ability to resolve configuration tasks
</details>

## Formal requirements

<details>

***KEEP IN MIND***

Fluture should be used to wrap your GraphQL calls and async logic. Please use the pipeline operator whenever possible


***TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS***

* your application should be refactored to take advantage of a real GraphQL API of your choice (example: https://beta.pokeapi.co/graphql/console/)
* the general theme of your application can, but does not have to be changed - however, try to find a structure similar to players/teams
* API calls should be wrapped in Futures sufficiently for reusability purposes

* schema mentioned above should be generated manually via yarn generate-schema command
* yarn generate-schema should act according to a changable configuration
* your application should provide autocompletion for gql calls based on the schema that was generated
* your application should use graphql-tag for gql queries
* please remove your fake API from the application
* the details of player/team that were previously opened in a modal should now have separate pages parametrized by ID which will fetch that precise player/team
* you should take advantage of pagination data provided by the API (if it does provide pagination data)

# Assignment - React 1

***

## Configuration steps

<details>

* Fork this repository to have this README.md present 
* Set your application with React up - ***WITHOUT CREATE-REACT-APP or similar***

</details>

## Assignment goal

<details>

The goal of this assignment is to set up a functioning React application, utilizing previously written code that now will have to undergo some refactorization, as well as using most of React's basic functionalities.

</details>

## Formal requirements

<details>

***KEEP IN MIND***
This task will require you to use your players/teams code - however, your HTML/CSS tasks are all themed differently. Try to make players/teams fit that theme - be it a team of hockey players, a team of random professions or familiada :)

Your application should utilize ***BOTH*** your HTML/CSS and JS projects, refactored accordingly.



***TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS***
* your application will be available via **yarn dev**
* your JS assignment code - fake "backend" for this project - should now generate players and teams with information about them - name, surname, description  for players; team name, list of player names, description for teams
  * there should now be 1-3 second delay when requesting players/teams, ***per request, not per team/player***
  * there should be a 20% chance to get an error, ***per request, not per team/player***
  * loading state and error state must be handled appropriately
  * you should use either a short predefined list to generate from, or a specialized module (such as faker)
* upper navbar should contain two links - to a list of players and to a list of teams
  * your application should contain routing to accomodate this
* your application should fetch 2000 players/teams
* left navbar should now be a pagination component, used to navigate the whole list of players/teams, 20 per page for players, 10 per page for teams
 * you should split the whole list into pages locally
* clicking on "details" button should show a modal window with a bigger version of the card that will fit all the details that may be cut off in small-format cards
* Ramda must be utilized wherever possible
* components should be reusable where possible
* try to look for an optimal solution to problems that arise, especially regarding your bundler configuration
* player list should be sorted by player name and surname
* team list should be sorted by team name
